# Variables

There are three ways to declare variables in JavaScript:
1. const
2. let
3. var

Variables are typically declared using const when their values or type should remain constant. If reassignment is necessary, let is preferred. var should be avoided except for specific cases requiring older browser support.

Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope, allowing them to be accessed throughout the function or script from the start, regardless of their actual declaration location.
