Engaged in learning JavaScript for penetration testing purposes as part of my current learning path. Planning on to advance to courses like [Secure Coding 101: JavaScript](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/secure-coding-101-javascript) and [JavaScript Deobfuscation](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/javascript-deobfuscation) on Hack The Box Academy.

Initially, recommended by Alex Olsen during a PJWT video.
