## What are the eight data types in JavaScript?

1. Number
2. BigInt
3. String
4. Boolean
5. null
6. undefined
7. symbol
8. Object

## Which data type is NOT primitive?

Object

## What is the relationship between null and undefined?

`null` represents a value equal to `nothing`, `unknown` or `empty` while `undefined` has no clearly defined value. In the context of comparisons, they are equal in a non-strict check.

```javascript
console.log(undefined == null); // true
console.log(undefined === null); // false
```

## What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?

Single and double quotes are treated identically. Backticks expand the quote functionality and allow for variable inclusions.

```javascript
let username = prompt("What's your username? ");
alert(`Creating a profile for ${username}.`);
```

## What is the term for joining strings together?

Concatenation

## Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?

Backticks (``)

## How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?

```javascript
let username = prompt("What's your username? ");
alert(`Creating a profile for ${username}.`);
```

## How do you use escape characters in a string?

```javascript
const escapeChars = "test \n \t\t\t what's up";
console.log(escapeChars);
```

## What is the difference between the slice/substring/substr string methods?


```javascript
const string = "Demonstrating the difference between slice, substring and substr methods."

// Slice: Returns a section of a string.
console.log(string.slice(14)); // From the 14th character onwards
console.log(string.slice(0, 14)); // From the first to the 14th character (exclusive).
console.log(string.slice(-1)); // Negative indices start from the end of the string.

// Substring: Returns the substring at the specified location within a String object.
console.log(string.substring(14)); // Same as slice.
console.log(string.substring(0, 14)); // Same as slice.
console.log(string.substring(-1)); // Negative indices treated as 0, thus, returning the entire string.

// Substr (Deprecated): Gets a substring beginning at the specified location and having the specified length.
```


## What are the three logical operators, and what do they stand for?

| Operator | Notation | Meaning |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| AND  | &&   | True if two values have the same value. |
| OR   | \|\| | If two values have different value. |
| NOT  | !| Negation of a logical statement.|


## What are the comparison operators?

| Operator | Description   |
|----------|---------------------------|
| ==   | Equal to. |
| !=   | Not equal to. |
| ===  | Value and type equal. |
| !==  | Value and type not equal. |
| >| Greater than. |
| <| Smaller than. |
| >=   | Greater or equal to.  |
| <=   | Smaller or equal to.  |

## What are truthy and falsy values?

A truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context. All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy. That is, all values are truthy except false, 0, -0, 0n, "", null, undefined, NaN, and document.all.[^1]

## What are the falsy values in JavaScript?

See above.

## What are conditionals?

## What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?

```javascript
if(condition){
// code
}
```
## What is the syntax for a switch statement?

```javascript
switch (expression) {
case value1:
// code block
break;
case value2:
// code block
break;
// add cases for other values as needed
default:
// code block for the default case
}
```
## What is the syntax for a ternary operator?

```javascript
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false
```
Example:
```javascript
const age = 26;
const beverage = age >= 21 ? "Beer" : "Juice";
console.log(beverage); // "Beer"
```


## What is nesting?

Placing a code structure within another one, i.e. double loops:
```javascript
for(loop_condition_1){
for(loop_condition_2){
// code block
}
}
```

```javascript
if(if_condition_1){
if(if_condition_2){
// code block
}
}
```

Generally speaking, something one should avoid as it makes code hard to read and most often means you haven't fully thought through your code.
