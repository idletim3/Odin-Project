There are seven [primitive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) data types:

- Boolean (true/false)
- null
- undefined
- number
- Bigint
- string
- symbol

All primitives are immutable; that is, they cannot be altered. It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primitive value. The variable may be reassigned to a new value, but the existing value can not be changed in the ways that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered. The language does not offer utilities to mutate primitive values.[^1]
