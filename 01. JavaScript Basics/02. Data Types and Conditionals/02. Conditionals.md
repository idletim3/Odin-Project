# Conditionals

Boolean Evaluations:

```javascript
console.log(2 > 1); // Outputs: true
console.log(2 != 1); // Outputs: true
```

String Comparison Algorithm:

1. Begin by comparing the first character of both strings.
2. If the characters differ, terminate the comparison.
3. Otherwise, proceed to compare the next character.
4. Continue this process until the end of either string is reached.
5. If both strings are of equal length, they are considered equal. Otherwise, the longer string is deemed "greater".

Type-based Comparisons:

```javascript
console.log('2' > 1); // Outputs: true (string '2' coerced to number 2)
console.log('01' == 1); // Outputs: true (string '01' coerced to number 1)

console.log(true == 1); // Outputs: true
console.log(false == 0); // Outputs: true

let a = 0;
alert(Boolean(a)); // Outputs: false

let b = "0";
alert(Boolean(b)); // Outputs: true

alert(a == b); // Outputs: true!
```

From a JavaScript perspective, these results are expected. During equality checks, values are converted to numbers (hence, "0" becomes 0), whereas explicit Boolean conversions follow a different set of rules.[^1]

The strict inequality operator `===` checks for equality without type conversion. If operands are of different types, `false` is immediately returned.

Example:

```javascript
console.log(1 === true); // Outputs: false
```

When comparing `undefined` and `null` using a non-strict check, `true` is returned.

```javascript
console.log(null === undefined); // Outputs: false
console.log(null == undefined); // Outputs: true
```

Some peculiar outcomes include:

```javascript
console.log(null > 0); // (1)
console.log(null == 0); // (2)
console.log(null >= 0); // (3)
```

In arithmetic and other comparisons (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), `null` and `undefined` are converted to numbers: `null` becomes 0, and `undefined` becomes `NaN`. Mathematically, this behavior may seem odd. The assertion "null is greater than or equal to zero" yields `true`, while "null is greater than zero" yields `false`.

The disparity arises from how equality checks (`==`) and comparisons (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) operate. Comparisons coerce `null` to a number (treating it as 0), explaining why (3) `null >= 0` is `true` and (1) `null > 0` is `false`. Conversely, the equality check (`==`) treats `undefined` and `null` as equals by default, without any conversions, rendering (2) `null == 0` `false`.[^2]
